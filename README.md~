# Setting up your Rasberry Pi Zero
WARNING:  Use Raspberry pi lite *buster* as the newer bulsey does not support omx player.  I tried vlc player, but was having trouble getting command line arguments for that to work.  For example it did not return to command line terminal despite trying --play-and-exit and trying vlc://quit at the end.  So, omxplayer it is.

Install raspberry pi lite to SD card using raspberry PI imaging utility.
Insert SD card into pi zero
boot
login username: pi
password: rasberry
